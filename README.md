# face_detection_recognition

### GOAL
Developing an AI application that can detect and recognize faces in
images or videos. Uses pre-trained face detection models like Haar
cascades or deep learning-based face detectors, and optionally
add face recognition capabilities using techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
